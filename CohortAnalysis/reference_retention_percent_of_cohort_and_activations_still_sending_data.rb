#================================oOo===================================
# This program helps you figure out how many entities that do an activity in a given week do a different activity in subsequent weeks
# For example, for users that create an account in a given week, how many of them login in subsequent weeks since their signup date
# This is commonly used for rentention analysis aka cohort analysis 
# You must have event data stored in Keen IO in order to run this analysis
# The program uses the Keen IO funnel analysis API to do the calculations
# The analysis can go back any num_weeks in the past and will run analysis for each week since that time (one cohort for each week)
# The results will be outputted to Terminal and also an excel file
# The total number of funnel analyses is num_weeks^2/2 so the query can take some time, espeically for very large event collections.
#================================oOo===================================

# Step 1 - Determine how far back in the past you want to go for this analysis.
# Calculations will be run for every week since that week, up until the most recent completed week.

# Step 2 - Enter your Keen Project Info

Keen.project_id = '<PROJECT_ID>'
Keen.read_key = '<READ_KEY>'

# Step 3 - Define your funnel steps. The first step will define your cohort groups. The last step will determine your "success" criteria.
# For example, say you are interested in login activity for customers who have paid
# step one: Submit Payment (groups customers based on the week they paid)
# step two: Login (counts how many of those customers logged in since the week they paid)
# Add any number of filters to any step (e.g. exclude test accounts).

#================================oOo===================================
# This program helps you figure out how many entities that do an activity in a given week do a different activity in subsequent weeks
# For example, for users that create an account in a given week, how many of them login in subsequent weeks since their signup date
# This is commonly used for rentention analysis aka cohort analysis. Cohorts are defined by the week they do the first step in the funnel.
# You must have event data stored in Keen IO in order to run this analysis
# The program uses the Keen IO funnel analysis API to do the calculations
# The analysis can go back any num_weeks in the past and will run analysis for each week since that time (one cohort for each week)
# The results will be outputted to Terminal and also an excel file
# The total number of funnel analyses is num_weeks^2/2 so the query can take some time, espeically for very large event collections.
#================================oOo===================================

# Step 1 - Determine how far back in the past you want to go for this analysis.
# Calculations will be run for every week since that week, up until the most recent completed week.
# num_weeks determines the number of cohorts in your analysis.

num_weeks = 52

# Step 2 - Enter your Keen Project Info

Keen.project_id = <PROJECT_ID>
Keen.read_key = <READ_KEY>

# Step 3 - Define your funnel steps. The first step will define your cohort groups. The last step will determine your "success" criteria.
# For example, say you are interested in login activity for customers who have paid
# step one: Create Account (counts the number of unique accounts that were created that week)
# step two: Login (counts how many unique customers in the cohort logged in that week)
# Add any number of filters to any step (e.g. exclude test accounts).
# You can optionally add filters to the steps.

$steps = [
    {
     :event_collection => "create_account",
     :actor_property => "account.id",
     # :filters => [{
     #           :property_name => "account.name",
     #           :operator => "ne",
     #           :property_value => "TestAccount"

     },
     {
     :event_collection => "logins",
     :actor_property => "project.account.id",
     },
 ]

# Protip: You may have more than two steps. Middle steps will further refine the number of candidates which make it to the last step.
# Step 4 - Run this script!

# These two nested loops run through all of the weeks since num_weeks ago, building funnel queries and running them.
